## Concurrency?
For concurrency support we'll have to put more effort into this program.

`watch.c` relies on consequtive events of:
- During of paths within monitored directories, IN_MOVED_FROM will be received first, follwed by IN_MOVED_TO
- IN_MOVED_SELF always run after IN_MOVED_FROM or IN_MOVED_TO events

This might be an issue when multiple processes modify directories and files within the watched paths as mentioned at `Dealing with rename() events` in [inotify(7) manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html):


>   **Dealing with rename() events**
>
>       As noted above, the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO event pair that
>       is generated by rename(2) can be matched up via their shared
>       cookie value.  However, the task of matching has some challenges.
>
>       These two events are usually consecutive in the event stream
>       available when reading from the inotify file descriptor.
>       However, this is not guaranteed.  If multiple processes are
>       triggering events for monitored objects, then (on rare occasions)
>       an arbitrary number of other events may appear between the
>       IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events.  Furthermore, it is not
>       guaranteed that the event pair is atomically inserted into the
>       queue: there may be a brief interval where the IN_MOVED_FROM has
>       appeared, but the IN_MOVED_TO has not.
>
>       Matching up the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO event pair
>       generated by rename(2) is thus inherently racy.  (Don't forget
>       that if an object is renamed outside of a monitored directory,
>       there may not even be an IN_MOVED_TO event.)  Heuristic
>       approaches (e.g., assume the events are always consecutive) can
>       be used to ensure a match in most cases, but will inevitably miss
>       some cases, causing the application to perceive the IN_MOVED_FROM
>       and IN_MOVED_TO events as being unrelated.  If watch descriptors
>       are destroyed and re-created as a result, then those watch
>       descriptors will be inconsistent with the watch descriptors in
>       any pending events.  (Re-creating the inotify file descriptor and
>       rebuilding the cache may be useful to deal with this scenario.)
>
>       Applications should also allow for the possibility that the
>       IN_MOVED_FROM event was the last event that could fit in the
>       buffer returned by the current call to read(2), and the
>       accompanying IN_MOVED_TO event might be fetched only on the next
>       read(2), which should be done with a (small) timeout to allow for
>       the fact that insertion of the IN_MOVED_FROM+IN_MOVED_TO event
>       pair is not atomic, and also the possibility that there may not
>       be any IN_MOVED_TO event.
