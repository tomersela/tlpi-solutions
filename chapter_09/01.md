Considering the initial set of process user IDs is real=1000 effective=0 saved=0 file-system=0:


effective is set to 0, means the process is priviledged.

## a) setuid(2000);

real=2000 effective=2000 saved=2000 file-system=2000

## b) setreuid(–1, 2000);

real=1000 effective=2000 saved=2000 file-system=2000

* real left unchaged becuase of the ruid is set to -1
* effective is changed to 2000 since the euid is set to 2000
* saved changed to 2000 since the euid param (2000) is different than the previous real uid (1000)
* file-system uid changed according to effective uid.


## c) seteuid(2000);

real=1000 effective=2000 saved=0 file-system=2000

* Only the effecive uid is changed
* fs changed accordingly

## d) setfsuid(2000);

real=1000 effective=0 saved=0 file-system=2000

## e) setresuid(–1, 2000, 3000);

real=1000 effective=2000 saved=3000 file-system=2000

* real is left unchanged since the ruid param is -1
* effective is set to 2000 and fs is changed accordingly
