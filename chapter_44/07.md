## Testing
```
$ ./nonblocking_open_reader 
Opening FIFO for reading with O_NONBLOCK...
Opened FIFO for reading (nonblocking mode) successfully.
No data to read (read() returned 0)
```

* The FIFO is opened for reading in nonblocking mode.
* Since no writer has the FIFO open, open() succeeds immediately.
* read() returns 0, indicating end-of-file (no writer is ever connected).

## Testing
```
$ ./nonblocking_open_writer 
Opening FIFO for writing with O_NONBLOCK...
No reader on the FIFO (errno=ENXIO)
```

* The FIFO is opened for writing in nonblocking mode.
* Since no reader is present, `open()` fails with `errno == ENXIO`.


# nonblocking_io.c
This program tests how nonblocking `read()` behaves on a FIFO when a writer is connected.

* The first `read()` returns `EAGAIN` because the writer is connected but hasnâ€™t written yet.
* The second `read()` succeeds after the writer sends data.

## Testing
```
$ ./nonblocking_io
Trying first read (writer connected but no data yet)...
read() would block (errno=EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK)
Trying second read (after writer has sent data)...
Read 5 bytes: hello

```

It demonstrates that nonblocking `read()` won't block and returns immediately based on FIFO state.
