The suggested approach in the exercise is problematic since it can cause a race conditions:

1. Between the time the server closes the descriptor and open the fifo again for reading, a client might write a message. But the client will get a SIGPIPE signal since there's no other process has the fifo open from the read-end.

2. The client might write data to the fifo just before the server closes it. In that case the client request will be lost.
