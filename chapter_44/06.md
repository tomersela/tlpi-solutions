# Recreating the problem
Before applying a patch, we need to recreate the problem so we later test if the patch is really solving it.

## bad_client.c
This client creates a FIFO, but never reads from it. This cause the server to hang and therefore not responding to other clients.

```C
#include "fifo_seqnum.h"

int main(void) {
    char fifo[CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN];
    struct request req = { getpid(), 1 };

    snprintf(fifo, CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN, CLIENT_FIFO_TEMPLATE, (long) req.pid);
    mkfifo(fifo, 0660);  // create a client FIFO, don't open it

    // send request to server
    int fd = open(SERVER_FIFO, O_WRONLY);
    write(fd, &req, sizeof(req));
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}


```

## Showing the issue
```

$ ./fifo_seqnum_client 1

$ ./bad_client
$ ./fifo_seqnum_client 1     # This client is blocked
^C
$
```

# Patching the server

## fifo_seqnum_server_mod3.c
This modified version of the server uses the `O_NONBLOCK` in order to open the client-fifo without being blocked in case the client didn't open that fifo for reading.

## fifo_seqnum_client_mod.c
With the modified server version, we're facing a new possible race condition.<br/>
This condition is less likely to happen with the retry mechanism we added to our server. But can still happen.

Suppose we have a really slow client - It writes a request to the server, but open its FIFO for reading only after 5 seconds.<br/>
In that case, the server try to open the client FIFO for writing the response. The server try 3 times (gets ENXIO error) until it gives up.<br/>
When the slow client finally open its FIFO for reading, it hangs (Since there's no process that opened the reply FIFO for writing).

In order to avoid that, we can also change the client to open the reply FIFO before sending the request to the server. In But just so the client won't block, we can work with the `O_NONBLOCK` flag.
