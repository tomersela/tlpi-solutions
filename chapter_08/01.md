The same username is printed twice since `getpwuid` is not reentrant - it returns a pointer to a statically allocated structure.

```C
    printf("%s %s\n", getpwuid(uid1)->pw_name,
                      getpwuid(uid2)->pw_name);
```

The second call to `getpwuid` overrides the value generated by the former call. Then `printf` prints the same string twice.
