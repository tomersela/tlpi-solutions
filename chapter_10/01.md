Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is 100. Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is an unsigned 32-bit integer, how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at 0? Perform the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().


## Cycle of clock_t value returned by times()
Assuming - sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) returns 100 and the clock_t value returned by times() is an unsigned 32-bit integer -

It would take 42949672 seconds ([max 32 bit int] / 100) before this value cycles.

This is longer than a year.


## clock_t value returned by clock()
1 Hour, 11 Minutes and 33 Seconds

CLOCKS_PER_SEC = 1000000

Therefore, it would take 4294 seconds until this value cycles and restarts at 0.
