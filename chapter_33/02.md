No, it is not guaranteed that the SIGCHLD signal will be delivered specifically to the thread that called fork().

In a multithreaded process, signals like SIGCHLD are delivered to the process, not to a specific thread. The kernel chooses one thread in the process to handle the signal, but which thread it chooses is unspecified unless the process takes steps to control signal handling.
