# Testing
```
$ ./epoll_fairness
Created and added fd 4 (read end of pipe 0)
Created and added fd 6 (read end of pipe 1)
Created and added fd 8 (read end of pipe 2)
Created and added fd 10 (read end of pipe 3)
Created and added fd 13 (read end of pipe 4)

All 5 descriptors are ready. Calling epoll_wait() with maxevents=1:
Call 1: returned fd 4
Call 2: returned fd 6
Call 3: returned fd 8
Call 4: returned fd 10
Call 5: returned fd 13
Call 6: returned fd 4
Call 7: returned fd 6
$ 
```

# Conclusion

When multiple file descriptors are ready and `epoll_wait()` is called with `maxevents` smaller than the number of ready descriptors, epoll uses round-robin ordering. 

As demonstrated by the test results:
- First round: returns fds 4, 6, 8, 10, 13 (in order they were added)  
- Second round: cycles back to fds 4, 6, ... (round-robin)

This ensures fairness - no descriptor gets starved when `maxevents` limits the number of events returned per call. Each ready descriptor gets its turn in a predictable rotating order, preventing any single descriptor from monopolizing the event queue.
