When `epoll_wait()` is called on an epoll instance with an empty interest list, it blocks indefinitely (if timeout is -1) waiting for events that will never come from the empty list.

This is useful in multithreaded programs where one thread calls `epoll_wait()` while other threads dynamically add file descriptors to the same epoll instance using `epoll_ctl()`. The waiting thread will wake up when events occur on the newly added descriptors.
