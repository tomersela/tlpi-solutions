```C
fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
fd2 = dup(fd1);
fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);
write(fd1, "Hello,", 6); // 1
write(fd2, "world", 6); // 2
lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET);
write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6); // 3
write(fd3, "Gidday", 6); // 4
```

1. The default offset when opening a file (without the `O_APPEND` flag) is 0.<br/>
Therefore, after the first write, `write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);`, the file's content is:
```
Hello,
```


2. fd2 is a duplicate of fd1. Therefore, they share the same open file table entry.<br/>
After `write(fd2, "world", 6);`, the file's content is:
```
Hello,world\0
```
Pay attention to the null terminator. "world" is 5 bytes, so the null-terminator is also included as we write 6 bytes into the file.

3. The call to `lseek` cause the offset of fd1 and fd2 to be 0.<br/>
Therefore,  `write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6);` overrides the first 6 characters which modifies the file content to:
```
HELLO,world\0
```

4. fd3 is attached to a new open file entry. The offset is 0 by default.<br>
The fourth write (`write(fd3, "Gidday", 6);`) will override the first 6 bytes.<br/>
The content of the file will be now:
```
Giddayworld
```
