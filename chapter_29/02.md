```C
static void *
threadFunc(void *arg)
{
    struct someStruct *pbuf = (struct someStruct *) arg;
    /* Do some work with structure pointed to by 'pbuf' */
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct someStruct buf;

    pthread_create(&thr, NULL, threadFunc, (void *) &buf);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

`buf` is a stack allocated variable.<br/>
Once the main thread terminates itself with `pthread_exit`, the stack address space can be reused later.</br>
Means that a pointer to `buf` will point on a space that can be reclaimed by other threads. And this can result in underfined behavior.</br>
