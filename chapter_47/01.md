# Blocking vs. Non Blocking
## Checking sem[0] == 0 (Non Blocking)
Here we check if sem[0] = 0. However, since we use the `n` flag (translated to `IPC_NOWAIT` flag when calling `semop`), the process isn't blocked and fails with `EAGAIN`:
```
$ ./svsem_op 0 0=0n    
18782, 23:27:44: about to semop()  [0=0n]
ERROR [EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK Resource temporarily unavailable] semop (PID=18782)
```

## Wait Until sem[0] == 0 (blocking)
```
$ ./svsem_op 0 0=0 &     
[1] 18822
18822, 23:31:09: about to semop()  [0=0]
$ ./svsem_op 0 0-1    
18859, 23:31:36: about to semop()  [0-1]
18859, 23:31:36: semop() completed [0-1]
18822, 23:31:36: semop() completed [0=0]
[1]  + 18822 done       ./svsem_op 0 0=0  
```

## Non-blocking Decrement on Zero
Here we try to decrement sem[0] below 0 with the `IPC_NOWAIT` flag, and fail with `EAGAIN`:
```
$ ./svsem_op 0 0-1n    
18899, 23:33:07: about to semop()  [0-1n]
ERROR [EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK Resource temporarily unavailable] semop (PID=18899)
```

# SEM_UNDO

To test SEM_UNDO, we need to kill a process before it has a chance to successfully terminate.<br/>
I was to lazy to adjust the program to do that, so I used gdb in order to pause after calling `semop()`.

```
$ ./svsem_op 0 0+1                                          # increment sem[0] by 1 (make it available)
19070, 23:46:05: about to semop()  [0+1]
19070, 23:46:05: semop() completed [0+1]
$gdb ./svsem_op                                             # run gdb

After running gdb, I added a break point right at the line where there's a call to `semop()`, and ran the program:
```
(gdb) b 115
Breakpoint 1 at 0x2020: file svsem_op.c, line 115.
(gdb) run 0 0-1u
Starting program: /mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_47/svsem_op 0 0-1u
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
20626, 22:25:12: about to semop()  [0-1u]

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=3, argv=0xfffffffff098) at svsem_op.c:115
115	        if (semop(getInt(argv[1], 0, "semid"), sops, nsops) == -1)
(gdb) 
```

I then typed `next` a few times to get passed the call to `semop`:
```
(gdb) next
118	        printf("%5ld, %s: semop() completed [%s]\n", (long) getpid(),
(gdb) next
119	                currTime("%T"), argv[ind]);
(gdb) next
118	        printf("%5ld, %s: semop() completed [%s]\n", (long) getpid(),
(gdb) next
20626, 22:25:30: semop() completed [0-1u]
109	    for (ind = 2; argv[ind] != NULL; ind++) {
(gdb) 
```

At this point, the semaphore value should be zero.

Now, from another terminal, if we first try to acquire the semaphore, we get an error:
```
$ ./svsem_op 0 0-1n
20748, 22:33:58: about to semop()  [0-1n]
ERROR [EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK Resource temporarily unavailable] semop (PID=20748)
```

But if we kill the paused process, the kernel undoes the semaphore action done by it. And then, we're able to decrement it again without getting blocked:
```
$ kill -9 $(pgrep svsem_op)
$ ./svsem_op 0 0-1n        
21067, 22:44:00: about to semop()  [0-1n]
21067, 22:44:00: semop() completed [0-1n]
```
