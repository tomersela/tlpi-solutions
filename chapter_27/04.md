```C
childPid = fork();
if (childPid == -1)
    errExit("fork1");
if (childPid == 0) {    /* Child */
    switch (fork()) {
        case -1: errExit("fork2");

        case 0: /* Grandchild */
            /* ----- Do real work here ----- */
            exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
        default:
            exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
}
/* Parent falls through to here */
if (waitpid(childPid, &status, 0) == -1)
    errExit("waitpid");
/* Parent carries on to do other things */
```

Two successive fork() calls yield a total of three processes related as parent, child, and grandchild.
- Having created the grandchild process, the child immediately exits, and is reaped by the waitpid() call in the parent.
- The granchild becomse an orphan and gets adopted by the init process.
- When the granchild terminates, it becomes a zombie and the init process will automatically reap it from the process table.


This technique is useful for situations where we want to execute a process which we can't (or don't want to) wait for. Having the grandchild adopted by init will make sure the zombie process will bre reaped by init (automatic cleanup!)
