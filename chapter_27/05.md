```C
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello world");
    execlp("sleep", "sleep", "0", (char *) NULL);
}
```

When standard output is directed to a terminal, it is line-buffered by default.

The above program yields no output since the printf statement includes no newline character. and therefore the text not being flushed.

However, the reason the stdio buffers not being flushed even at the end of the program is because of the `execlp` statement - `execlp` executes a new process, overwrites the existing programâ€™s heap (including the stdio buffers), which wipes out the unflushed output.
