Running `./t_execlp xyz`, given the shell session details, will execute the xyz program under dir2.

The execvp() function first fails to exec the file xyz in dir1, because execute permission is denied. It therefore continues its search in dir2, where it successfully execs xyz.

`execlp` searches for the first executable named with the given `file` argument in all directories specified in the `PATH` environment variabele.

Since the xyz program under dir1 isn't executable, `execlp` skips it and eventually choose the xyz executable under dir2.

## Testing
```
> mkdir dir1
> mkdir dir2
> export PATH=$PATH:./dir1:./dir2
> echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\necho "Hello"' > ./dir1/xyz
> echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\necho "Hello 2"' > ./dir2/xyz
> chmod +x ./dir2/xyz                                 
> ./t_execlp xyz
Hello 2
```
