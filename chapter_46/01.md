# Basic usage

## Creating a message queue
The following command creates a new message queue (`-c` sets the `IPC_CREAT` flag). We're creating a key using ftok (the `-f` option yields a call to `ftok("/tmp", 1)`)
We allow read/write permissions for the current user (the owner) with `0600`.
```
$ ./svmsg_create -c -f /tmp 0600
0
```

`msqid = msgget(key, flags | perms);` (svmsg_create.c) creates or accesses a message queue.

## Sending a message

```
$ ./svmsg_send 0 5 "Hello there"
```
* 0 - Message queue ID from the previous step
* 5 - Message type
* "Hello there!" - Message text

`msgsnd(msqid, &msg, msgLen, flags);` (svmsg_send.c) sends a message of the `struct mbuf` form.

## Receiving a message
```
$ ./svmsg_receive 0             
Received: type=5; length=12; body=Hello there
```

`msgrcv(msqid, &msg, maxBytes, type, flags);` (svmsg_receive.c) receives a message from the queue.

By default, type is set to 0, therefore, we receive any message


# Blocking vs. Non-Blocking

## Receiving a message
Normally, the receiver will block until a message is available:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive 0 &
[2] 30125
$ ./svmsg_send 0 5 "Now you can leave"
Received: type=5; length=18; body=Now you can leave
[2]  + 30125 done       ./svmsg_receive 0

```

We first run the receiver program in the background. The receiver waits (blocked) until a message is available.

Only after we send a message using `svmsg_send` we see the `svmsg_receive` program prints the received message and terminates.

Now, let's try to read a message from an empty queue. This time, without blocking:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive -n 0                
ERROR [ENOMSG No message of desired type] msgrcv
```
The `-n` command flag sets the `IPC_NOWAIT` of the `msgrcv` call. This time the program terminates immediately, telling us no message is available.

## svmsg_send with IPC_NOWAIT
For experimenting with the `IPC_NOWAIT` flag in `msgsnd`, we need to create a situation where sending a message would block.<br/>
One of such situations is when the queue is full. I created a script to fill the queue:

### fill_queue.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <msqid>"
    exit 1
fi

MSQID="$1"
COUNT=0

MSG=$(head -c 1023 < /dev/zero | tr '\0' A)

while ./svmsg_send -n "$MSQID" 1 "$MSG"; do
    COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
done

echo "Queue $MSQID filled after $COUNT messages."

```

So we first create a new queue and run this script in order to fill it:
```
$ ./svmsg_create -c -f /tmp 0600
1
$ ./fill_queue.sh 1
ERROR [EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK Resource temporarily unavailable] msgsnd
Queue 1 filled after 16 messages.
```

Now, if we try to send a new message, it gets blocked:
```
$ ./svmsg_send 1 1 "Can I tell you something?"
```

But by setting the `IPC_NOWAIT` flag (by using the `-n` option), we immediately get the `EAGAIN` error:
```
$ ./svmsg_send -n 1 1 "Can I tell you something?"
ERROR [EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK Resource temporarily unavailable] msgsnd
$
```

# Truncate an oversized message
Assume we're sending a long message:
```
$ ./svmsg_send 0 5 "The big outage last quarter? Yeah, it wasn’t a DNS issue. One of the co-founders tried to mine Dogecoin on production during off-hours. There's a video log buried in the S3 archive under compliance/camera-footage. You can decrypt it using the password prod4coins"
```

If we set the max-bytes argument to a number which is smaller than the length of the message, we get an error:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive 0 256
ERROR [E2BIG Argument list too long] msgrcv
```
This sets the `msgsz` argument of `msgrcv` to 256.

But with the -e option, which sets the `MSG_NOERROR` flag on `svmsg_receive`, the message gets truncated:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive -e 0 256
Received: type=5; length=256; body=The big outage last quarter? Yeah, it wasn’t a DNS issue. One of the co-founders tried to mine Dogecoin on production during off-hours. There's a video log buried in the S3 archive under compliance/camera-footage. You can decrypt it using the password pr
$
```

# Filtering by message types
The -t option sets the `type` argument of `msgrcv` to the specific type int. We can use it to get messages of a specific type while skipping messages of other types:
```
$ ./svmsg_send 0 1 "Type 1"                         
$ ./svmsg_send 0 2 "Type 2"
$ ./svmsg_receive 0 -t 1                            
Received: type=1; length=7; body=Type 1
$ ./svmsg_receive 0 -t 1
```
The second run of `svmsg_receive` blocks since there are no further messages of type 1.

we can utilize the `-x` option to set the `MSG_EXCEPT` and get all messages of other types than the one we specified:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive 0 -t 1 -x
Received: type=2; length=7; body=Type 2
```

# Priority queue
In case we run `msgrcv` with a `msgtyp` argument set to a number lower than 0, `msgrcv` acts as a priority queue.

> If msgtyp is less than 0, the first message of the lowest type that is less than or equal to the absolute value of msgtyp shall be received.
(https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/msgrcv.3p.html)


Let's send 3 messages of different types to a new queue:
```
$ ./svmsg_create -c -f /tmp 0600                 
2
$ ./svmsg_send 2 5 "Low priority"       
$ ./svmsg_send 2 3 "Medium priority"
$ ./svmsg_send 2 1 "High priority"
```

running `svmsg_receive` with type = `-2`, will return the message with the lowest type ≤ 2 — type 1 ("High priority") in our case.


```
$ ./svmsg_receive -t -2 2
Received: type=1; length=14; body=High priority
$
```

Running again, but this time with type = `-4`:
```
$ ./svmsg_receive -t -4 2
Received: type=3; length=16; body=Medium priority
$
```
We get type 3 ("Medium priority"), since it’s the lowest ≤ 4.
