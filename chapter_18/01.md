The inode of the longrunner file changed before and after the compilation.

```bash
> ls -li ./longrunner
83938437 -rwxr-xr-x 1 debian debian 72344 Dec 28 23:49 ./longrunner
> ./longrunner &
[1] 14173
> Program will run for 20 seconds. Press Ctrl+C to exit early.

### Here I manipulated the longrunner.c with another program

> make

[1]  + 14173 done       ./longrunner

```

The key lies in the inode and how Linux manages file references:

The running program continues to use the old inode because it still has a reference to it (open file descriptor).

The new executable is written to a new inode, and the directory entry longrunner is updated to point to this new inode. (cc probably unlinks the longrunner entry before creating a new one).

This approach avoids conflicts because the old file is not physically overwritten while the program is running. It is only unlinked and deleted when no processes have references to it.
