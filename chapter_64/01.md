The child process terminates first, then the parent.

Since the Terminal attached to script process is in raw mode, control-characters are passed directly to the forground process without generating singals (or `EOF` in the case of Ctrl+D).<br/>
So when we type Ctrl+D, this character is read into a buffer, and from there written to the master-terminal fd and hence sent as an input to the slave-terminal (which is in canonical mode).<br/>
The slave-terminal translates that character as EOF, so when the shell (child) process tries to read further input, it sees there isn't any an terminates.<br/>
After the child terminates, the parent will try to read from `masterFd`, get EIO error and exit.
