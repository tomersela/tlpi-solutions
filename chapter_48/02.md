If we update `svshm_xfr_reader.c` with the following loop, we'll cause a race condition between the writer.<br/>
This is because we read from the shared memory region as part of the loop condition (`shmp->cnt != 0`) before reserving the semaphore.

```C
for (xfrs = 0, bytes = 0; shmp->cnt != 0; xfrs++, bytes += shmp->cnt) {
    reserveSem(semid, READ_SEM); /* Wait for our turn */
    if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, shmp->buf, shmp->cnt) != shmp->cnt)
        fatal("write");
    releaseSem(semid, WRITE_SEM); /* Give writer a turn */
}
```
