## a) Removing all owner permission from a file denies the file owner acces, even though group and others do have access
```bash
> make
cc -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -g -I../lib -pedantic -Wall -W -Wmissing-prototypes -Wno-sign-compare -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wno-unused-parameter   -c -o file_perms.o file_perms.c
cc -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -g -I../lib -pedantic -Wall -W -Wmissing-prototypes -Wno-sign-compare -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wno-unused-parameter    t_stat.c file_perms.o ../libtlpi.a   -o t_stat
> ls -l 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 debian debian 81344 Dec 15 19:23 t_stat
> chmod u-rwx t_statc
----r-xr-x 1 debian debian 81344 Dec 15 19:23 t_stat

tomersela@debian:/mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15$ ./t_stat 
Usage: ./t_stat [-l] file
        -l = use lstat() instead of stat()
```

## b) On a directory with read permission but not execute permission, the names of files in a directory can be listed but the files themselves can't be accessed, regardless of the permissions on them

```bash
> mkdir test
ls -l | grep test
drwxr-xr-x 2 debian debian    64 Dec 15 19:27 test
> cd test
> touch 1
> touch 2
> touch 3
> cd ../
> /usr/bin/ls -l test

> cat test/1    
cat: test/1: Permission denied
```

## c) What permissions are required on the parent directory and the file itself in order to...

### create a new file
The minimal permissions required are write and execute permissions
```bash
> mkdir test
> chmod u-rwx test
> echo "hello" > test/file.txt
zsh: permission denied: test/file.txt
> chmod u+x test
> echo "hello" > test/file.txt
zsh: permission denied: test/file.txt
> chmod u+w test
> echo "hello" > test/file.txt
zsh: permission denied: test/file.txt
> cat test/file.txt           
hello

# removing execute permissions proves it is required
> echo "hello" > test/file2.txt
zsh: permission denied: test/file2.txt
```

### open a file for reading
The minimal file permission needed for reading is read-permission:
```
> chmod u-rwx test/file.txt
> cat test/file.txt              
cat: test/file.txt: Permission denied
> cat test/file.txt      
hello
```

The minimal permission needed on the parent directory is execute permission:
```
> chmod u-rwx test
> cat test/file.txt
cat: test/file.txt: Permission denied
> chmod u+x test
> cat test/file.txt
hello
```

### open a file for writing
In order to open a file for writing, we need to set write permission on it:
```bash
> chmod u+rwx test # temprarily restore permissions on test directory in order to run chmod on the file within it
> chmod u-rx,u+w test/file.txt # set write permission on file.txt
> echo "hello" > test/file.txt # write works
```

Now let's check the required permission for the containing directory:
```bash
> chmod u-rwx test # removing all permission of the user for the test directory
> echo " world" >> test/file.txt
zsh: permission denied: test/file.txt
> chmod u+x test # adding execute permissions to the owner for the test directory
> echo " world" >> test/file.txt # write works
> cat test/file.txt # read denied (as expected)
cat: test/file.txt: Permission denied
> sudo cat test/file.txt # file got modified
hello
 world
```

### delete a file
No permissions are needed on the file
```bash
> chmod u-rwx test/file.txt # removing all owner permissions on the file
> chmod u-rwx test # removing all owner permissions on the test directory
> rm test/file.txt
rm: cannot remove 'test/file.txt': Permission denied
> chmod u+x test
> rm test/file.txt
> rm: remove write-protected regular file 'test/file.txt'? y
rm: cannot remove 'test/file.txt': Permission denied                 # just execute is not enough
> chmod u+wx test
> rm test/file.txt 
rm: remove write-protected regular file 'test/file.txt'? y
# success (no error)
```

### What permissions are required on the source and target directory to rename a file?
No permissions are required for the file itself. but both target and source directories requires write and execute permissions.
```bash
mkdir source
> mkdir target
> echo "test" >> source/file.txt
> chmod u-rwx source 
> chmod u-rwx target
> mv source/file.txt target/file.txt
mv: cannot stat 'source/file.txt': Permission denied
> chmod u+wx source
> chmod u+wx target
> mv source/file.txt target/file.txt
> cat target/file.txt
test
```
Removing either execute or write permissions from either the source or target directory denies the renaming of the file (saved the experiment recording for brevity).

### If the target file of a rename operation already exists, what permissions are required on that file?
No permissions required for either the source or target file
```bash
> echo "override" > source/file.txt
> chmod u-rwx source/file.txt
> mv source/file.txt target/file.txt
mv: replace 'target/file.txt', overriding mode 0044 (---r--r--)? y
```

### How does setting the sticky permission bit (chmod +t) of a directory affect renaming and deletion operations?

When the sticky bit is set for the parent directory, then a file can only be renamed and deleted by the owner of the file.
 ```bash
 > chmod o+t test
 > echo "sticky bit" >> test/123
 > ls -l | grep test
d-wxr-xr-t 6 debian debian    192 Dec 15 20:19 test    # Sticky bit is set
> mv test/123 test/456  # move is allowed for owner
> su - tomersela
Password: 
tomersela@debian:~$ cd /mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15/
tomersela@debian:/mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15$ mv test/456 test/789
mv: cannot move 'test/456' to 'test/789': Permission denied
tomersela@debian:/mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15$ rm test/456
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'test/456'? y
rm: cannot remove 'test/456': Permission denied
tomersela@debian:/mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15$ cat test/456
sticky bit
tomersela@debian:/mnt/macos/tlpi-solutions/chapter_15$ exit
```
