The three timestamps of a file:
* atime - last time the file was read
* mtime - last modification time of the file
* ctime - last change time of the file metadata

The `stat()` system call access the inode information of the file without changing it. Also, it doesn't access the actual file data. Therefore, none of the three file timestamp are expected to change.
